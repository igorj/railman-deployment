- `cap ENV deploy`        => Deploy rails application
- `cap ENV remove`        => Remove the application completely from the server
- `cap ENV reset_server`  => Recreate server database from db/<application_name>.sql
- `cap ENV sync_local`    => Synchronize local database with the production database

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 

To release a new version, run `bundle exec rake release_patch`, `bundle exec rake release_minor`, oder `bundle exec rake release_major`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to https://rubygems.org.
